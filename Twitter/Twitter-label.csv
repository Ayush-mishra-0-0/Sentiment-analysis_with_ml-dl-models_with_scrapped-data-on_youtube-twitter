‚û°Ô∏è There is a vacuum in the DPI architecture globally. Cashless paperless transactions have been possible in India because we created that kind of DPI for the people here. The challenge is how to take it across the 133 nations where 4 Bn people do not have a digital identity and 3 Bn do not have a bank account.

‚û°Ô∏è India needs to be in the driver‚Äôs seat and get global organisations to put in the resources to take it around the world. A Global DPI Consortium may be created.

‚û°Ô∏è There is a need for a Technology Setting Standards Organisation which will create and manage standards for the DPIs.

‚û°Ô∏è DPIs need to be linked to AI in a very big way to keep it relevant for the future.

‚û°Ô∏è Cybersecurity is paramount and will be the key to the future. It is important to take care of it to manage the whole DPI framework.
