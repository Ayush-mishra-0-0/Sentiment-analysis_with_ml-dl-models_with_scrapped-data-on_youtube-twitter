# YouTube Data Analysis & Visualization Project

## What is this project about?

This project analyzes YouTube videos and comments related to the **G20 Summit 2023**. It uses Python to clean, process, and analyze the data, then creates visualizations to show insights. The goal is to understand what people are saying in the comments, find patterns, and summarize the content in an easy way.

Think of it like reading a bunch of YouTube comments, figuring out if theyâ€™re positive or negative, grouping similar comments, and finding key topics people are talking aboutâ€”all done automatically with code!

---

## Why did I make this project?

I wanted to:
- Explore what people think about the G20 Summit 2023 through YouTube comments.
- Practice data analysis and visualization skills using Python.
- Learn how to use cool tools like sentiment analysis, clustering, and topic modeling to understand text data.

---

## What does the project do?

The project takes a dataset of YouTube video links, titles, and comments about the G20 Summit 2023 and does the following:

1. **Cleans the Data**: Removes unwanted stuff like user mentions (e.g., @username) from comments to make them easier to analyze.
2. **Explores the Data**: Looks at the data to understand its structure and basic stats (like how many comments, average length, etc.).
3. **Analyzes Sentiments**: Checks if comments are positive, neutral, or negative (e.g., "Great event!" is positive).
4. **Groups Similar Comments**: Clusters comments that talk about similar things and shows them in a 2D scatter plot.
5. **Finds Relationships**: Creates a network graph to show how videos or comments are connected.
6. **Identifies Topics**: Finds the main topics in comments (e.g., "leadership," "economy") and shows how common each topic is.
7. **Summarizes Content**: Picks out important keywords from comments to summarize what theyâ€™re about.
8. **Categorizes Comments**: Groups comments into categories using a classifier (like "praise" or "criticism").
9. **Discovers Trends**: Finds patterns in the data using a technique called t-SNE to see how comments relate to each other.
10. **Improves Search**: Makes it easier to search for comments by linking them to topics.

## How does it work? (Step-by-Step)

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **What I did**: Loaded the data (a CSV file called `Youtube_scrapping_comments.csv`) and looked at the first few rows using `df.head()`. I also checked basic stats with `df.describe()` and `df.info()` to understand the data.
- **Cleaning**: Used regular expressions (a way to find and remove patterns) to remove user mentions like `@username` from comments.
- **Why**: This makes the data cleaner and easier to analyze.

### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**
- **What I did**: Used a library called **TextBlob** to analyze each comment and label it as Positive, Neutral, or Negative based on its tone.
- **Example**: A comment like "Iâ€™m so proud of this event!" gets labeled as Positive.
- **Why**: To understand the overall mood of the comments.

### 3. **Clustering Comments**
- **What I did**: Used **SentenceTransformer** to turn comments into numbers (embeddings) and **UMAP** to group similar comments. Then, I created a 2D scatter plot to show these groups.
- **Why**: To see which comments are similar and group them together visually.

### 4. **Network Analysis**
- **What I did**: Used **NetworkX** to create a graph showing connections between videos or comments (e.g., if they mention similar things).
- **Why**: To understand relationships in the data, like which videos have similar discussions.

### 5. **Topic Analysis**
- **What I did**: Used **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** to find the main topics in the comments and made a chart to show how common each topic is.
- **Example**: Topics might include "G20 leadership" or "global economy."
- **Why**: To summarize what people are talking about most.

### 6. **Content Summarization**
- **What I did**: Used **Gensim** to pick out important keywords from comments.
- **Example**: Keywords like "Modi," "summit," or "India" might stand out.
- **Why**: To quickly understand the main ideas without reading every comment.

### 7. **Content Categorization**
- **What I did**: Used **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to turn comments into numbers and a **Naive Bayes Classifier** to group them into categories (e.g., "praise," "criticism").
- **Why**: To organize comments into meaningful groups.

### 8. **Discovering Trends**
- **What I did**: Used **t-SNE** to reduce the data into a 2D space and find patterns in how comments relate to each other.
- **Why**: To spot trends or clusters in the data that arenâ€™t obvious.

### 9. **Enhancing Search**
- **What I did**: Linked comments to topics so itâ€™s easier to search for specific ideas.
- **Example**: If someone searches for "leadership," theyâ€™ll find all related comments.
- **Why**: To make the data more useful for finding specific information.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: The main programming language.
- **Pandas**: For loading and organizing the data.
- **NumPy**: For math and number crunching.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating charts and visualizations.
- **NetworkX**: For making network graphs.
- **TextBlob**: For sentiment analysis.
- **SentenceTransformer & UMAP**: For clustering comments.
- **Gensim**: For keyword extraction.
- **Scikit-learn**: For TF-IDF, Naive Bayes, and KMeans clustering.
- **Transformers**: For advanced text processing.
- **Scattertext**: For visualizing text differences.
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: For cleaning comments.

## Whatâ€™s in the Data?

The dataset (`Youtube_scrapping_comments.csv`) has these columns:
- **Video Link**: The YouTube URL of the video.
- **Video Title**: The title of the video (e.g., "World leaders arrive at the Bharat Mandapam").
- **Cleaned_Comments**: The comments after cleaning (still includes user mentions in the raw form).
- **Item**: All rows are labeled "G20 2023" to show theyâ€™re related to the summit.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Install Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. **Install Libraries**: Run `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn networkx textblob sentence-transformers umap-learn gensim scikit-learn transformers scattertext` to install all needed tools.
3. **Get the Data**: Place the `Youtube_scrapping_comments.csv` file in the same folder as the code.
4. **Run the Code**: Open the `Youtube_Data_analysis&Visualisation.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell step-by-step.
5. **View Results**: Youâ€™ll see tables, charts, and graphs showing the analysis!

## What I Learned

- How to clean and prepare text data for analysis.
- How to use Python libraries for sentiment analysis, clustering, and topic modeling.
- How to create visualizations like scatter plots and network graphs.
- How to find patterns and insights in real-world data like YouTube comments.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add more data from other events to compare with G20 Summit 2023.
- Use more advanced models for sentiment analysis or topic modeling.
- Create an interactive dashboard to show the results.
- Improve the cleaning process to handle emojis or non-English comments better.

### Notes for Your Interview

- **Keep it Simple**: Explain the project like youâ€™re talking to someone who doesnâ€™t know coding. Start with the big picture (analyzing YouTube comments about G20) and then mention a few key steps (cleaning, sentiment, topics).
- **Highlight Tools**: Mention libraries like Pandas, TextBlob, and Gensim to show your technical skills, but donâ€™t get too technical unless asked.
- **Show Visuals**: If you can, bring screenshots of your scatter plots, network graphs, or topic charts to make it visual and engaging.
- **Talk About Challenges**: Mention any issues (e.g., messy comments, non-English text) and how you solved them (e.g., regular expressions for cleaning).
- **Connect to the Job**: If the job involves data analysis, Python, or text processing, explain how this project shows those skills.

Good luck with your interview! Let me know if you need help practicing your explanation or preparing for specific questions. ðŸ˜Š
