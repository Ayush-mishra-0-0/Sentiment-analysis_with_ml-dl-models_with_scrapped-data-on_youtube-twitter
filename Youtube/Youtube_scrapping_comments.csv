@Amuzic_Earth - I was more inclined towards use of the name ""India"" internationally...but after seeing that placard with ""Bharat"" written on it, I must admit, it does carry more weight, like the literal meaning of the word....and I have also come to realize, while the word India reminds me of young, tech loving country with vibrant, colorful and energetic people, the word Bharat reminds me of ancient civilizational and continuous history, a land of spirituality in its truest sense and wisdom, a true melting pot of people from all over the world... Hence I love both and I think so far the name Bharat was overshadowed by the Name India, but each carry their own representation and should be uplifted equally.

Literally elevated Indian food right here! So many ancient grains and delicacies that too vegetarian presented in such an appealing manner. I agree with comments here wish there was some way to taste this menu?
@DrZubairulIslam - Congratulations India, It's lovely to see, probably the world's most diverse dinner.

@parvathamma1 - Wow.. kudos to team. Very proud of being Bharatiya
@sureshchithaly - The condition of India's opposition is pathetic.. They won't accept the success of g20.. They see all this as BJP's political drama.. They can't see the rise of India.
@chandrajoshi2216 - God Sent Modiji . Thanks for your infinite contribution to our nation. The world leaders and the true citizens of Bharat are very proud of you for a grand presentation of our diverse cuisine to include all millets. 
@ramamurtipaluri2420 - I was born one year before Independence and have obviously no personal knowledge of British Raj in India.  But lot of information was pumped by my late father and many others of that time.  They said without exception the British administration of all departments was top class and to them all Indians are plain Indians and of course  low mortals; much earlier part of the century, say is 20s, Indians were considered subhumans. They also said even a petty British Officials were all powerful, demigods, and the higher officials like District Collector, Superifntemdemt of Police one could not see them in their eyes.  Almost all officials were not corrupt and treated Indians with same yardstick.  If my father and grand parents and Winston Churchill were to be alive today they would  have been shocked beyond imagination to see that a person of Indian lineage is ruling Great Britain.
@ShailendraSingh-oj9ul - Bharat is the home of every Hindu.. Doesn't matter where he lives...

I thank all the respected leaders and say come again. 
@1973dineshkumar - It was total Vegetarian menu. Modi got G20 declaration signed by the leaders without serving any Non Veg Food to westerners who eat Non Veg 3 times a day. That is new Bharat and Modi is the most appropriate leader.

@saifulbari825 - ️🇧🇩️🇮🇳️ I am from Bangladesh and I congratulate all Indians for the successful Indian scientific mission to the moon. Also, I thank the Indian people for welcoming our PM Sheikh Hasina. We are grateful to India for helping us during our liberation war against the then West Pakistan. We value India Bangladesh friendship forever. Bangladesh wants to maintain friendship with all countries including the USA and China. Infact, the USA and China are the two major trading partners of Bangladesh. In the present regional and geopolitical context, the present government under the leadership of PM Sheikh Hasina has been facing multi-dimensional challenges. For example, Sheikh Hasina's government has been maintaining secularism in Bangladesh (a Muslim majority country) and fighting against Islamist terrorists, which is a major threat to peace and prosperity of Bangladesh and to regional security. Secondly, PM Hasina and her party Awami League historically have a policy of maintaining close friendship with India and its people, but some unresolved issues like the Tista water sharing agreement contribute to existing anti- Indian sentiment among Bangladeshi people fueling Islamic fundamentalism that goes against Sheikh Hasina and her government. Third and most importantly, the USA hegemonic pressure and hostile actions against Bangladesh. The Hasina government does not want to be aligned with the USA against China which is a major trading and development partner of Bangladesh. That is why the USA is on a mission of regime change in Bangladesh overthrowing the Hasina Government. The USA has been patronizing the main opposition party BNP and other Islamic fundamentalist parties, which leaders often call for the destruction of India, against the Hasina government in the upcoming national election, which is due in 4 months. The USA already imposed sanctions last year on some top officials of a law enforcement agency citing human rights violations. Also, the USA threatened to impose more sanctions on the present government in the pretext of ""facilitating democracy.""

@perambu3441 - Those who came to the G20 summit are not your guests but the guests of our Indian nation. Vegetarianism is not the problem but serving only vegetarian food is the problem. Hospitality should include both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. What food to eat is a personal choice of a guest and you should not impose Brahmanism on it and especially on people's tax money. A pig that enters the middle of the house will destroy the house and that is what is happening in BJP rule.

@arunavaguha7191 - There should have been non-vegetarian items also. A huge part of the guests are non-vegetarian.

1. Ration shop non basmati Rice or roti with lentils
2. Veggies : potato, onion, tomato (@ 10/kg...!)
@siddharth0401 - All these leaders showed great interest and praised the indian culture, food and dances etc, but ordered food from zomato at night and savoured old delhi kebabs, butter chicken, naan etc after they are back in the hotel
@drishaantrivedi159 - It can be said ""Dawat"". Because dawat has different connotations. Pl correct
@perambu3441 - Why is only vegetarian food served at the G20 summit?

It is sad that the BJP has imposed Brahminical principles on the food served to foreign guests with the tax money of the Indian people. If the BJP really wants to serve traditional Brahmin food then the menu should include cow dung.
@chinthanaillukwatte - Wow!!! Sunak and lady 
@mykonos8452 - No matter wat tukde gang led by pappu does....this man has the leadership capability to take India to Great heights....shame on some who don't support Modiji

@parimalag508 - Why certain group of people are degrading the govt.of TN.  If the condition of the state is so poor why are they thronging all the educational institutions,hospitals,factories & other facilities developed by the govt. run by those parties.  In the past 10 years the population of these group of people in Tn has increased to that level to reach 40%.  And they are reaping the benefits of our 50 years hard work and shamelessly criticizing us. And these people are standing in queues to taste the healthy,cheap & delicious tamil cuisine.

@gomathakamadhenu1607 - A MUST READ FOR ALL INDIANS - This article appeared in The Hindu in the 1940's..... when late Mr Kasturi (N Ram's uncle ) was the editor..The article can be republished without changing even a word!

Being a Hindu in Bharat

      Sir, _ I am a Hindu and have been a Hindu since my birth. As I call my Self a Hindu, the Indian government will look on me as a communalist  . A Hindu in Indian is expected to be ashamed of his religion and not talk about it in public, He must proclaim that he is secular. He must be toleran  when Hindus are attacked and Hinduism is ridiculed. Hindus believe that all religions lead to the same truth. Some other religions proclaim their uniqueness and feel that there can be salvation only through their religion. They want us to embrace their religion out of concern for the pagan Hindus. Hindus accept the right to convert others, some redicule  Hindu gods and goddesses at street _ comer meetings and Hindus do not propagate their faith by fair or foul means.

@saifulbari825 - ️🇧🇩️🇮🇳️ I am from Bangladesh and I congratulate all Indians for the successful Indian scientific mission to the moon. Also, I thank the Indian people for welcoming our PM Sheikh Hasina. We are grateful to India for helping us during our liberation war against the then West Pakistan. We value India Bangladesh friendship forever. Bangladesh wants to maintain friendship with all countries including the USA and China. Infact, the USA and China are the two major trading partners of Bangladesh. In the present regional and geopolitical context, the present government under the leadership of PM Sheikh Hasina has been facing multi-dimensional challenges. For example, Sheikh Hasina's government has been maintaining secularism in Bangladesh (a Muslim majority country) and fighting against Islamist terrorists, which is a major threat to peace and prosperity of Bangladesh and to regional security. Secondly, PM Hasina and her party Awami League historically have a policy of maintaining close friendship with India and its people, but some unresolved issues like the Tista water sharing agreement contribute to existing anti- Indian sentiment among Bangladeshi people fueling Islamic fundamentalism that goes against Sheikh Hasina and her government. Third and most importantly, the USA hegemonic pressure and hostile actions against Bangladesh. The Hasina government does not want to be aligned with the USA against China which is a major trading and development partner of Bangladesh. That is why the USA is on a mission of regime change in Bangladesh overthrowing the Hasina Government. The USA has been patronizing the main opposition party BNP and other Islamic fundamentalist parties, which leaders often call for the destruction of India, against the Hasina government in the upcoming national election, which is due in 4 months. The USA already imposed sanctions last year on some top officials of a law enforcement agency citing human rights violations. Also, the USA threatened to impose more sanctions on the present government in the pretext of ""facilitating democracy.""

@shibboleth111 - Sir, your honorable Prime Minister Modi. I am a Canadian woman who is aware of the embarrassment presented to you by our prime minister. On behalf of my fellow Canadians I wish to offer you a sincere and heartfelt apology for his hypocrisy on the issue of foreign influence.  We are presently, as a nation dealing with that very threat, but from an entirely different government than the one he is so hypocritically pointing fingers at. Please accept our humble apologies from the bottom of our hearts ,he is despised in his own country and he betrays us continually .All of our best wishes from Canada to India, as your dear friends , please  and thank you for your time Sir, in your good name

Changing our mother nation's name is like changing our mother. India is not just a name but it is also our identity. Changing our identity is like ripping our soul of our body.

Somebody are pointing BRICS+ but remember all BRICS nations are in G20 already. So it will be good for african countries to join G20. World nations should work together for eradicating poverty without any divide.
@GHAWBBA - ADDING AFRICAN UNION IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVE OF MODI IN G20 ALSO WITHOUT THOSE LEADERS I STILL THINK ITS A HIT SUMMIT
@courage04 - Individual African countries might be insignificant but the whole union can't be ignored.
@eze3922 - Congrats India I think most of the world are happy with this news.
@tvm73836 - Amrita Cheema is an impressive reporter. She is not just “reporting” but provides her valuable perspectives also unlike other “reporters”
@arijitkumardutta3229 - Congrats to African Union. Long live India African Union relationship. We Indians aways with Africa for all time. 
Love  from India 🇮🇳
@sps6 - African Union had no chance to be included into G20 without modi…congrats to Africa on this historical moment
@ItsAnkit_Kumar - Contrary to the historical actions of some nations, India has consistently extended a helping hand to countries in need, striving to uplift them and integrate them into the global community. This approach underscores India's commitment to fostering international cooperation and development, rather than exploiting the vulnerable.
@akash4606 - Africa is getting the recognition it deserves. 
@vibha.v2999 - A very well deserved step for making the African Union a permanent Member... Thanks to Modi ji for this big step
@devsanjay7063 - Proud to be Indian from colonial looted to world  eye catch india strongly building it's presence in world economic development

@manimodi - Congratulations African Union  one Earth  one family  
Congratulations from Bharat (India)
@applesoranges559 - Right from the Joint Congress Address at the White House to every Singular Global Event ... Its actually  Narendra Modi that has Continuously n RELENTLESSLY pushed for the real Voice of the continent of Africa, all over the planet, onto the World Stage from Day 1     ..
@obeyr8232 - Warm welcome to all the dignitaries of g20 nations from 1.4 billion population of India.. enjoy the summit n be commitment to the decisions for smarter future ....
@umeshyadavoffical - African origin anchor questioning addition of African union in G20 is hilarious
@pssocial4563 - It's Bharat's ancient culture about whole world is family, ""Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam"".... Kudos to PM Modi for including everyone.
@tommyboss4067 - Bravo India.
This is an execellent move from India to free Africans from colonialism by diplomatic approach. India makes a faith-accomply action to ousted all the West/UK/USA colonialism from Africa while the West/UK/USA are all in panic situation.
@sandeepborse8907 - Congrats all african brothers and sister, in G 21, one earth one family
@beast6029 - India did a good thing by pushing for African Union in G20. Africa deserves a place on the global stage.
@desitravellover2376 - I love my India🇮🇳
@user-ns6kv7mk3m - Welcome on board African Union . Waiting for more individual African nations to join further !
@Lumix861 - Thankyou India 
@Cenkolino - Its a good decision to finally get african nations to the G20. Africa has over 1.2 billion people and they deserve representation.
@surendrabarik6404 - Congratulations African Union... love from India (Bharat)
@AndersLiljeblad - Great news for the world!
@vinay11163 - XI jinping and putin must have diverted the focus from real issues its good that they are not in G20 but both nations are represented by there 2nd top ministers of the country. africa union is a long awaited and it will be the highlight of this year G20. africa will be the growth engine of the future.
@akshaybagal2196 - India support African union 
@TheMolabola - About time, African union welcome to G20
@naamkoitamna8675 - This shows how Important Bharat(India) is. 
World adopts what Bharat advice.
@stanleyekhator6967 - The fear of Bricks & the rise of Russia/ China growing influences is the beginning of Wisdom for the West & respect for Africa
@KiRKiRA369. - Great job PM Modi .. Bharat and Africa friendship
@rahulmehta3986 - Congratulations African union welcome to G21
@mrD66M - G20 was not an arbitrary group, it was the 20th strongest world economies. EU counts as a bloc because of common rules /regulations / currency (for the most part) / policy. I struggle to see how African Union fits in G20
@yayati2539 - We also need to include African union alongwith G4 countries to be made permanent member of security council with a veto power
@samanthaw4955 - This is a case of the small western block of G20 countries having to listen to the majority of G20 countries not in the western alliance. This is why so much has gotten done at this summit. It comes down to the west not being allowed to drag it’s feet any longer on issues that don’t include war.
@WorldCitizen0000 - The western world should engage more with India and the African Union. If we don't we just make it easier for China and Russia to spread their influence. And India and several countries in Africa are democracies although there's some very serious issues like persecution of minorities in India and corruption in South Africa. And lets not forget the countries in the American continent.
@The108thlotus - No one is really missing Xi but Putin is kind of being missed.
@tivo3720 - Its a very good super work done by India  a big big achievement is the  exceptance of more than 100 declarations  by every countries.
@chandrasekarsundaram9811 - Congratulations African union
@andypenn4711 - Most of these leaders do not decide anything without their owners :) - just a show for the world to watch and hope for the best
@Mjixa - Forget about China and Russia, let the rest of the world flourish and aim to develop stronger economies
@HolloMatlala1 -  ....Finally Africa will unite under 1 unanimous vote for G20 it's 1 Vote but come UN thats 28% of Block Power under the 54 Countries under the African Group (the largest UN continental Block)  + 2nd largest block Asian Pacific (27.5) =55,5% Global .... Thank You G20 for giving us a platform to unite under 1 Voice 1 Vote....
@surendervasudevan8593 - Each year G20 happens,every host nation spoke for the sake of their  gain,but today India Modi stood for Africa,just imagine how many effort has been putted by modi to get African union a permanent seat among Top 20 economies in world ! The kind of questions faced by him  why a instable ,poverty African representations needed ,what gain do we get etc,..Modi spoke for African union in addressing US congress to convince them....Only India understands the pain of Africa ,what it needs ...Africa need Recognition not aid to act as colony and missionaries  for Rich countries!  I again urge African nations not to take sides between western and Russia/ China....they can afford show off and war but not us ! speak what you need ,  Ask each country a deal for your products instead of aid and compassion ! Each African nations is a hidden Gem,only you can shine it ! As Brothers we share same culture ,colonization, poverty .. time to shed ....
@metromaster7025 - Last G20 made headlines about Ukrainian pm called it G19
This G20 made headlines about the world calling it G21
@rupigurjar5721 - 🇮🇳Bharat mata ki jai 
@marilynlucas5128 - So most of these so-called developed economies get so much from Africa but Africa was never part of the G20? What a sham! When at all will African states become wiser and trade only with each other? This is unbelievable!
@lightoos8409 - This summit is historic  now they will call G21
@RupeshSingh-ov9ei - One earth one family one future....only bharat can give this slogan...we all r one family......appretiate p.m. modi ji to introduce this bharti slogan to world...
@None12768 - congratulations to all the brothers and sisters of africa from India. lets grow together and bring our historical glory back
@michaelojiako5688 - As an African/ Nigerian precisely, I want some one to comment on the  ""Objectives, Roles, relationship, agendas of these following groupings: Africa Continental Free Trade Area, African Union, BRICS, G20, Cop 26,27,28 etc, and the role the new technologies (e.g AI/Robotics) which Africa have no control thereabout will play with respect to scramble for African natural resources which are critical to the new green economy. And also, why were Xi and Putin absent ( Putin could have come if he really wanted to from my understanding) 
@Analysis_Dock - russia only see Africa as a buyer of his wapon
china see as buyer of its goods and try to control africa's natural resource BUT,
only India Give them respect and oppertunity to Standup and do betterment of his citizen.
@iarpanbose - China and Russia both attended the summit only putin and xi are not attending. Why are you guys suddenly crying for putin and xi ?

@raghavsingh. - Many many Congratulations to African Union on becoming a permanent member of G-20 and now it will called G-21
@thanatos1243 - congrats africa from india 🇮🇳🇮🇳
@leonalchemist - While it would be great for Africa to be part of a democratic world, I also know they are very very strongly looking to make Russia and China closer friends, which is a direct opposite of what the rest of the world wants; as well as the mass corruption, everyone living in Africa knows the decades of corruption isn't going anywhere, if they can't follow basic human rules I'm not sure how it's all going to work out.
@soumyajitsingha9614 - Its going really well since the problem nations are not attending
@ArabicReja973 - This year, G20 achieved a lot more and was trouble-free because Chinese 🇨🇳 Xi Jinping was absent...
@solomonokoli212 - Wait, so will South Africa give its  spot up to another country and join the AU as a single member, or the G20 will have both South Africa  and the African Union?
@Crashed131963 - Do they do the same for the EU in the G20 or are the countries  separated in the G20 ?

So news should be correct.
@tikakita - Modi PM of India/Bharat deserves the Noble peace prize for Inclusion. Africa has always been treated so badly by the rich countries of the world. Thank you Modi.
@ivanexell-uz4mv - I love seeing Russia and China isolated 
@talkingdrops - Let me list you what happend on the first day of G20 delhi :-

1- whole African continent as one member ( African union ) became a part of G20 because there voice is needed to be heard 
@HameSe - this is nice.. is it possible if instead of sending Indonesia as the representative of the ASEAN region.... maybe ASEAN itself (ASEAN chairman) can  be invited instead.
@gtribeb2225 - It is good time for African brothers and sisters.
@aniketghadage5981 - I dont care about xi but i realy miss putin
@SDM496 - India is doing impressive job of bringing the world together by being rhe the voice of the global South. Africa needs its rightful place in the world order..
@georgekwong7886 - The small circle of more than 4 billion people should bear half of the responsibility for climate change. Because this area consumes the most resources and emits the most carbon !    If these densely populated places are not responsible for addressing climate change,     there will be no sustainable economic developmemt.  Instead to create more international conflict and trouble.
@itssbp - Congratulations to all in Africa
@jkuang - My prediction is that there is NO CONCENSUS AGREEMENT, which is the hallmark of success for G20 meetings.  Without CONCENSUS AGREEMENT, it is just a hosted party for leaders of the world to shake hands and take photos.  In fact, I will also predict there won't be any group photo too.
@sarathsrt - Great step by India and Modi
@ankit-ro1dv - Glory🇮🇳🇷🇺
@DheerajSingh-hu5dd - Most sucessful G20 ever....!! And on top of it, this summit is so colourful and vibrant too, unlike previous.. boring and politically challanged...!!
@Nik-th8fk - PM Modi is a goat In the time of corona when all rich countries were hoarding Vaccines Modi gov provided vaccines to poor and developing countries specially to south of the globe ... He raised voice many times about G20 membership of African union.. This is Real Leader who wants to uplifting all.. who believes in ""One Earth, One Family, One Future""...
@thebeautifulanimal - They sent the 2nd most powerful leader of their country. They should have joined but hopefully it gonna be a success.
@virendraSingh-je3sx - India stands with prople of India and also invested 72 billions USD for prosperity of people of our friendly nations of Africa.
@SAURABH3103 - Bali was Bali, and You are in NEW DELHI. 

The most powerful countries will always get their way by whatever means."" is the most accurate sentence for the BHARAT
@maboketshabeclement4078 - Russia's war in Ukraine, rather than with Ukraine . That's exactly what it is because Russia is fighting the west in Ukraine. India is very smart they see it for what it is!
@uttamsinghn3574 - Congratulations 
@kunalghosh4211 - Delhi declaration has been unanimously accepted and only Modia and India 🇮🇳 could have done it. No wonder Xi chose to hide

@Hanamantaray - Congratulations AU . 🇮🇳
@trinitybricks9522 - I don't think Xi is missed in India, with the kind of trade deficit we already have with China. 55 countries in one African vote is very inefficient. I don't think they're all going to be in agreement on anything.
@mcdronzy - Finally, africa is getting some voice :)

@thewolf7687 - India saved westerns countries from economic challenge by china and Russia both of making Bricks strong on the path of Bricks own currency against G20 but adding African continent (50 countries) G 20 became more powerful.....it wouldn't replace dollar now
@priortokaraew7569 - when xi is around, there is an air of repulsive heaviness in the air
@koushik-eg8bg - Leopard 2 tank was fantastic
@Aryan_H1 - India removed Ukrainian drama from Delhi declaration & it was accepted by all Nations. In the middle of the war.

Now that's some unprecedented diplomatic skills.
@rickcummings3938 - Probably all the better that the two biggest crime bosses were not in attendance.   They should be too ashamed of their unforgivable behavior to ever be in the company of good, decent leaders.
@strongfoot2009 - G20 leaders agree to make African Union a permanent member: this is a very good idea going forward. However, India is a real pain for both G20 and the BRICS as it keeps on bringing all sorts of hurdles to the table.
@PiotrKuczaj - About time. Wise move
@neo26 - DW is pretty slow  
Consensus already reached on ALL issues
@G-Man01 - Clearly Xinping is NOT the real leader of Asia. He might be Asia's best thug, but he doesn't have anyone's heart.

@devourergaming - INDIA - Indian Congress and seeing benefits of their own interest
BHARAT - Sanatans, seeing benefits for Global welfare.
@paulxu9653 - Africa has been sick of the western empty talks for multiple centuries . Now, Bharat joins the chat. Who will trust a nation that can’t build enough toilets for its people and demolished thousands of the poor’s shelters for its egos ahead of the summit.
@meilinchan7314 - Ironically it is people like Sunak and Modi who are fuelling a lot of the mistrust in the world.

@vishnunarayan8850 - Absolutely Amazing. Putin has his own reasons which we understand and Xi can get lost for all we care..Bharat is doing a great job hosting his summit.
@hummingbird6427 - Suddenly poorer Africa asked to have a seat in world richest countries club? Why now? India is playing a very risky part to counter China's belt and road program around Asia and Africa. Most of the Asian countries already joined with the Chinese economic program will find this as threat to their economy. I don't understand why a poor country like India dangerously getting itself in war between western blick vs Russia and China?
@abhishek_patra_ - Where is there is India 🇮🇳, there is hope for life & humanity ....
@joanweightman2275 - What does it say for BRICS if Jinping and Putin can't or won't attend G20? Suppose it's BIS as usual.
@kausikgupta6846 - The reason is EUROPEAN UNION is a declining empire & AFRICAN UNION is a rising star.

@johnnybegood3017 - Why hasn't an invitation to the G20 been made for BRICS itself as an economic bloc seperate from it's component states that are also in the G20 ? 



The EU economic block is a member of the G20 seperate from it's component nations that are also members of the G20 (Germany, Italy, France), and thus so should BRICS ... it IS, after all --- a far larger and far more important economic block than is the EU..... the largest economic entity on the planet, as a matter of fact.

@antonystark3303 - 1:53 Fantastic!!!
@gerardobaltodano - La inclusion de la Union Africana no es mas que una estrategia de occidente para lograr un acercamiento a los paises africanos, resentidos por los daños que ha producido occidente en su pasado colonialista y racista. Su estrategia es para enfrentar la creciente influencia de China y Rusia (que no son colonialistas). Es una estrategia de neocolonialismo y neoracismo. En realidad a occidente lo unico que le interesa de Africa son sus recursos. Occiednte quedo retratado en Africa cuando ayudo economica y militarmente abundantemente, al regimen de apartheid en Sudafrica (ayudando a sus iguales blancos).

@normanthoelert9752 - Question is, for example Mali she mentioned was excluded of the African Union…… but then she complains that they’re not together with the African u ion in G20? Ukraine is in a real war not in a conflict! She obviously don’t know what unity means. Ukraine joining G20 belongs to unity.

@hilltopintegratedfarm1693 - Turkey and India are having the same foreign policy. Africa union another puppy of uncle and EU
@masterblaster9086 - The size of economy (in trillions) are brain numbing techniques used by the western countries (post WW2) to have poor countries keep working for them. India in not the global engine of growth but the global supplier of cheap labor and consumer of western products and that is exactly what US wants them to do. As for living condition, most tier 1 and tier 2/3 cities are unlivable due to roads overflown with traffic, pollution and high density of population. There is not even a concept of public playgrounds, garden or other public amenities in India. Indian primary education is getting more and more expensive. Modi govt. has done nothing except working towards facilitating the corporates (both indian and foreign) to tap the overcrowded indian cities to their advantage. In return he gets all the help (funding) from these blood thirsty organisations (Adanis/ambanis) to win elections.

@pundalikwalke1590 - Changing will be burning in jeolosy 
@PatSen - Amrita Cheema is a lazy reporter. She was not prepared, gave anodyne answers which were at least a day old. For example, when she said that Xi not coming was also a slap on India’s face. It was not. If she had read the latest reports she’d have known that it’s much more a face-saving move for Xi who would’ve been pummelled for the map issue. Second, Xi is doing a repair job at home after receiving a verbal hiding by CCP seniors. He is on a sticky wicket and he thought it was prudent to lie low.

It is not a place for conflict resolution.... This is true and we fully agree with that 🇮🇳.. 
@kartikaypatel23 - The USSR had played a critical role in supporting India during the 1971 India-Pakistan war. The United States, on the other hand, had backed Pakistan at the time and opposed the liberation of Bangladesh.
@okechukwuirokanjo8323 - India 🇮🇳: The G20 is a group of countries who gather for economic progress and not for conflict resolution, what an intelligent and smart statement 
@shilpam85 - As an Indo-Canadian, I’d rather prefer for Trudeau to focus on issues at home and stop encouraging and harbouring antisocial separatists and individuals. We have enough issues in Canada that he needs to divert his attention to than trying to play God elsewhere!

@tarmotyyri6733 - As far as I know, Ukraine is not a member of G20, so what business does Zelensky have in New Delhi other than begging for money & military support?
@babubhaiyaa11 - We love Russia, a true friend 
@vijayjoseph8164 - Canadian PM worried that G20 would not be entertaining without Zelensky's  comedy show. 
@RichterBelmont2235 - Ukraine have had too many chances at ending the war. They can sue for peace at this point and it is what India would've tell them to do and maybe even act as a bridge due to India being on friendly term with Russia. Ukraine has no place asking India to ""play a bigger role"" in ending the war, that's just stupid and self-centered.
@nisthur - i still remember when Russia and Ukraine was on hold .. what a power leader narendra modi is ! 
@jrs2002 - Eventhough India was the first country to recognise Ukraine when it became an independent country, ukraine has always supported Pakistan, be it in arms deal or Kashmir issue or nuclear tests. Now they want India to have a bigger say. And by the way, G20 or not, the war is not going to stop anytime soon, no matters where, how many and what type of resolutions are passed.
@ishygoel - Trudeau needs to take some classes on India's history with Russia, but I frankly do feel like USA may have provoked him to bring up this issue again. What fools

@Death__0 - We have spent Billions of $ to prepare everything top notch so that our guest can have good experience, we don't want such an important summit to be fully centered around Ukraine like previous G20.
      Besides, Nothing actually come of out it just like last time except some words against Russia.
@elnovato1741 - If there is a summit called ""42O"" - Zelensky should get the invitation first and the next invitation can go to Khangress..
@ams-animeedits6562 - ""G20 is an economic forum"" its the straight reason and if Ukraine is invited ,this will turn this forum into a international quarreling of countries instead of a productive economic meeting and if Canada really want to help he should ask  NATO countries which are just adding fuel to war and not  organising diplomatic talks with Russia just to protect their worthless pride
@skaracaesar4789 - Zelensky ought to come to his senses and realise not every summit is his theatrical show.  If he tones down and speaks peace, he might be invited.
@edwingan1758 - No problem, you're not alone. Putin & Xi also not joining.

@saifulbari825 - ️🇧🇩️🇮🇳️ I am from Bangladesh and I congratulate all Indians for the successful Indian scientific mission to the moon. Also, I thank the Indian people for welcoming our PM Sheikh Hasina. We are grateful to India for helping us during our liberation war against the then West Pakistan. We value India Bangladesh friendship forever. Bangladesh wants to maintain friendship with all countries including the USA and China. Infact, the USA and China are the two major trading partners of Bangladesh. In the present regional and geopolitical context, the present government under the leadership of PM Sheikh Hasina has been facing multi-dimensional challenges. For example, Sheikh Hasina's government has been maintaining secularism in Bangladesh (a Muslim majority country) and fighting against Islamist terrorists, which is a major threat to peace and prosperity of Bangladesh and to regional security. Secondly, PM Hasina and her party Awami League historically have a policy of maintaining close friendship with India and its people, but some unresolved issues like the Tista water sharing agreement contribute to existing anti- Indian sentiment among Bangladeshi people fueling Islamic fundamentalism that goes against Sheikh Hasina and her government. Third and most importantly, the USA hegemonic pressure and hostile actions against Bangladesh. The Hasina government does not want to be aligned with the USA against China which is a major trading and development partner of Bangladesh. That is why the USA is on a mission of regime change in Bangladesh overthrowing the Hasina Government.  The USA has been patronizing the main opposition party BNP and other Islamic fundamentalist parties, which leaders often call for the destruction of India, against the Hasina government in the upcoming national election, which is due in 4 months. The USA already imposed sanctions last year on some top officials of a law enforcement agency citing human rights violations. Also, the USA threatened to impose more sanctions on the present government in the pretext of ""facilitating democrsome""
@Sam-yt9qj - It is a proud moment for India indeed to host the G20 summit and achieve success e.g. inclusion of the African Union and get the communique out. It's a proud moment for most of the Indians, I guess! However, when I hear what Rahul Gandhi is saying in Europe, it gives entirely a different pic. Why India is so divided where something positive is happening in Delhi and at the same time not so positive narrative coming out of a leader?
@lakshmisaripella6559 - New Delhi leadership in G20, simply marvelous.

@santhini1962 - A great outcome! Loka Samastha Sukino Bhavanthu! Hats off Modi ji and team! Declaration and so many important decisions made! Decisions that are far sighted for the prosperity & wellbeing of so many nations. 
Africa, the cradle of human civilisation! It must prosper for the planet to prosper. Common good and development of every nation in the planet, should overcome greed and subjugation. When we can buy a T shirt for $2.00, it means someone out there involved in the making of that T Shirt, right from the cultivation of cotton to the shop, is missing out in a BIG WAY! That is not sustainable. It will coming crashing down and definitely take the whole planet down the drain with it!

@achaks85 - Hats off to Rahul Gandhi. Admire the knowledge and intelligence with which he explained the present politico social situation in India while taking  press conferences in Paris and other foreign countries these days. I endorse him 100% in his assertion that once this perverted so called hindutya regime is ousted in totality, India with its intrinsic ancient values and it’s democratic fabrics it will again be the best democratic country of the world. Rahul very rightly refused to blame squarely only to Modi for this present extreme exploitation   in India, rather he identify it as a sinister coalition between RSS and BJP and Modi is only pressed to implement their grand nasty plan of keeping their rule going in India at any cost. Modi is only implementer of the grand plan of RSS - PJP’s created structure.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Grspbh_1piA&pp=ygUIRzIwIDIwMjM%3D,The Battle to Build India’s First Bullet Train,"@Rash_max_2007 - What's the problem? If the slums were out in open , I am sure this same media would complain about ""Over crowding"" , ""Too unhygienic"" , ""bad smells"" but for the summit to run smoothly, they are just being shifted , they come to delhi for better job opportunities, they're not permanent residents, so why is it being portrayed as if India is caught red handed?
@aruns425 - Successive Indian governments did try to demolish slums by offering alternate lands or compensation, however liberal left & Western funded NGOs  on the behalf of the  people affected in the process file cases in the courts against demolitions, thus halting or slowing the process. Another fact is that large slums such as the one in Mumbai are a huge vote bank for the politicians, so the government generally ignore it. Finally many slum dwellers even if relocated still go back to living in the slums due to employment opportunities. So in other words this is a very difficult problem to solve at least in a democratic setup. Even in places like Germany, the migrants from Africa are building new slums and the local authorities are struggling to control them.
@rajeshv9140 - In UK there are many who live on the streets. It is unfortunate to see in the developed country 
@blueseaswhiteskies - When brazil hosted the world cup, they did the same thing
@kinnugangula2984 - The colonial British rule in India, which lasted for nearly two centuries, had profound and often negative effects on the Indian subcontinent. Some of the major adverse impacts include:

 1. Economic Exploitation: The British East India Company and later the British Crown exploited India’s resources, leading to economic stagnation and the draining of wealth from India. Taxes, land revenue, and trade policies heavily favored British interests.
@manishrathoria268 - It is no shame, all knows Delhi is place of serious over crowd.. Those who stays in slums are not homeless like US .. They have home in Bihar , UP and othe poor states but living in Delhi  for better job opportunites , and  rent in place like Delhi are serious high.. I stayed in slum for 6 months when I came from  my home town Rajasthan.. It is not actually bad to stay.. Friendly neighbourhood,
@shivam_nagar69 - Full Story :
These people in Slum illegally occupied land, in Mumbai few yrs ago many people were given free houses after removing the slums, but what they did do?
They rented those houses and created new slums.
@himanityagi1588 - There is no way that we can demolish poverty all of a sudden. It is an integral part of every country. But the thing is that Indian poverty is the most interesting thing for global media. How many times do we see the same media taking interest in the poverty status of other countries like China, Singapore or UK?  It's not that those countries don't have this side.... It's just that there is a global media that has always shown one side of India to the world and now for once we are getting the opportunity to turn it around, they simply can't see it...
@human8454 - British colo*nialism killed 100 million Indians in 40 years
Between 1880 to 1920.
Experts agree that the period from 1880 to 1920 – the height of Britain’s im*perial power – was particularly devastating for India. Comprehensive population censuses carried out by the colonial regime beginning in the 1880s reveal that the de*ath rate increased considerably during this period, from 37.2 deaths per 1,000 people in the 1880s to 44.2 in the 1910s. Life expectancy declined from 26.7 years to 21.9 years.
@Brown-Wesker - Poverty and inflation is skyrocketing in Britain. Instead of obsessing over india, they should focus on themselves.
@rjradhakrishnan - Didn’t Congress led UPA Government do the same during the Commonwealth games in Delhi?  I didn’t see a similar commentary back then.  Slums are a reality and needs to be addressed, but nothing wrong in making the area of G20 clear of these sights.  Do you expect US to host such an event in the middle of a skid row in Los Angeles or near the homeless shelters of San Francisco?  No, O don’t think so.
@SHINCHAN_N0HARA - The bigger question is after 70 years of UPA why people are still under poverty 
@mis.apart.jorhat - Slum ever were in the world not only india... even USA have a slum area don't forget... Brazil and Indonesia already used same kind of formula.
@QH96 - The word Sindhu is Sanskrit for river. Hindu is the persian way of saying it and Indu is the Greek way. India is named after the Sindhu (Indus) river that flows through Pakistan.

@ahmadahmadi7263 - in 2019 me and few friends traveled from Delhi towards south for around 4 months and we realised that poverty is all over india and i meant the gap between bottom class and top class citizens where to much and infrastructure where from british colonial time and you get nice builds and new houses but the system haven’t done enough for its people . some local explained to us that same people are in power from 1960 and runs by same family’s. in short indian are amazing people but government is really bad . the poverty is really high. i seen it with my eyes baby born on street and i seen person died in he’s bed in the street.
@user-jz4up7eq4v - Well there is no country on this planet free from poverty & domestic problems...

@reenasuthar2579 - It is suggested that the British media expand their coverage of India's accomplishments beyond the G20, to provide a more comprehensive perspective and avoid perpetuating narrow-minded views. It is concerning that videos related to this topic receive less coverage compared to others, hence, it is encouraged that the British media provide more coverage on India's accomplishments and promote a balanced portrayal of world events. 
@bluesteel1 - This so called ""Jawaharlal Nehru University"" is a hellhole where despite being Indian they raised slogans for breaking India apart. Long Live the liberals and rich elite. Also we all know Nehru was boytoy of Lady Mountbatten. Patel was the on who was Democratically elected and meant to be the first premier until Gandhi stepped in and made Nehru leader
@Homelandee5 - Currently, he is the national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party, which won the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections with a historic majority, obtaining 67 out of 70 assembly seats.
@ancient1927 - 1:29 
This is love for country and Nation .
@shenlee2680 - It's so ironic to use your own advertising image to block the slums.
@1bhaihay - The World leaders should make it a point to visit the slums of New Delhi to assure that they care for all Indians & not just Modi & the privileged few. That would be the greatest achievement of the G20 Summit.
@jayanandannair2753 - A lot of YouTube videos are in circulation in India, depicting poverty in the U. K. ( and also some western countries ). It is not as grave as in India, where 1.4 billion are to be fed.
@samcalvinist4986 - All major cities of India have big slums, for example: cities like Bangalore, Mumbai (Bollywood city)  Kolkata, Pune, Chennai all have large chunk of their respective population living in Slums.
Not only that India is also famous for its farmers suicide, Large number of Farmers commit suicide every year in that country,  Also the country India is very dangerous for women with number of Women getting Raped in India is also very high.
@gopinathsahoo8981 - Delhi is a city of 46 million people. It's easy to carry a terror attack. The systemic beautification has a logistical & security angle too. It regulates traffic flow, pedestrian entry, secures venues.
20 years back, India's parliament was attacked by Pakistani militants. This is not an unlikely scenario.
@femylijo - India is a huge country and its development will be faster because of hardworking and patriotic human resource
@user-qz3to7gd5l - Brazil did the same thing during Rio Olympics.
Moreover, UK too have evacuated homeless people out from street during London Olympics.
I have one question, Why after 60 years of congress & UPA rule there exist Slums and Poverty in India? Why secular congress failed to uplift poverty in country for last 60 years of their rule.
@aruns425 - The British Obesession with India still continues despite curtains falling on the Empire 70 years ago.
@powerprivilege6790 - If Turkey, Ceylon, Cambodia can change the names to PRE-Colonial names so can INDIA!!!  Get it!!!
@simonsoumnathtudu8492 - british media is jelous nice to see. when you point 1 fingure you forget other four are ponting at you.

@MrFaltu. - It is really a great sin to be born poor in this world.  Without money this life is in vain 
@ayush2448 - Channel4 should make an in-depth documentary on why India has so many poor people. Should tell the world the amount of money Europeans looted from India. 

India's biggest threat isn't from outside but from paid external agents operating within India.
@jameshanson6803 - Countries have literally been destroyed after war and still have nowhere near the slums or poverty that is found in India. Look at Germany, Germany was defeated after ww2, cities were completely bombed to rubble, and were occupied by the allies.  But they have rebuilt themselves and have a gdp larger than India with a population around 80 million. Look at South Korea, a country that was destroyed after the Korean War and split in half. Today they are a developed country with no slums the like found in India and have companies like Samsung. The problem with India is eternal victimhood instead of just acknowledging their problems and fixing them. India under modi has become a country not capable of criticism.
@kabirr3088 - A glaring example of UKs repeated attempts to patronise India on self governance! Sad to see them sulking over their loss of blood stained colonial racket called as “empire”.
@Kittypie_official - In my opinions its nothing new in the whole world... there are too many countries who does the same, even when they are developed.India is trying to develop. we know it's a thing that we should not cover but still without the cover people will see this too. So just don't blame india for this. India has done a lot of things so just 1 thing can't change the efforts of the country.Everyone should understand that it's for the country where we live. without us the country will not be named as India....This is the only country with so many religions, so many languages, so many dressing style....The country known for its spices. We are the people who make India
@RuchiKashyap7 - Proud Indian People 
@kavindulakshan859 - If India rises, it is a shame to do such things. I feel sorry for the oppressed people.

@Boldtruths - Great video channel 4.
Modi will come in 2024 
THANKS for supporting him in an indirect way.
HE WILL IMPROVE HIS WAY OF WORKING.
@krishnaprasannavankayala5988 - Every country has poverty, homeless people and slums.  India is not an exception to this. There is no need to be ashamed of this situation. Our government is trying their level best to remove the people out of poverty. Eith the huge Population in the country, it is not possible to provide all the resources to the public.
@ajaydhayani2045 - Delhi is home of so many non citizens from East neighbours...Delhi leaders loves them and uses them .. before we have guest we clean our house...same has been done.  Good Job Bharat.
@Boldtruths - 3:55 Founder of India jawaharlaal nehru it is like saying founder of sun Galileo.

India os more than 7500 year old civilisation. 
Some brainless can't be its founder.
@Sahil-cu9pz - Great that's we we call real journalism show good and bad side of country 
@jassingh2360 - Anything that has been demolished wil be rebuilt in around 2wks, its extremely rare for any slums that have been demolished to not reappear in a matter of weeks, so demolishing serves zero purpose
@lorrainedraper8503 - The UK did the same for the queen's jubilee.  It's not just indian government that do this
@pradipraychaudhuri7252 - Money ,muscle powers , diplomacy are the key of success.
@avikdey6818 - Great thought of these legends
@gayatrimanjunath - when guests come home we also cover and hide things to make our look beautiful. that is done with intention of up keeping respect of our family and home. same is true with a national also. that is a kind of showing respect to the visiting guests. washing dirt linen in public is disgraceful to our guests be it at home or our national.
@kasardevi8 - thank you for the coverage that main channels hide!
@Unrevealingexistence - Shameful. Imagine what the people in the slums feel about it, like they're not something to be shown, below standard. You're just concealing the truth, a lot of people in India live in such conditions. They are not any less human or have any less worth than any other human. Putting sheets over them to conceal them like they're not something that can be shown just shows the disgusting mindset that people have towards them.
@praveshmudgal2973 - Every where it can be easily seen 
1) Like Western
2) Like USA
3) Like Middle East
@barhaa01 - Don't pay any attention to these colonialist mindset media clowns for viciously attempting to malign India; folks don't stop your aspiration and efforts to uplift our fellow Indians and Global South.
@hirenahir76200 - Well as an indian i agree with you india should work on future technology and high manufacturing to uplift poverty and made everyone's life better 
@manaswinimishra6604 - Here indian govt successfully lifted 450 million people from poverty in just 10 yrs which is bigger than usa population if modi rule usa he made America a homeless country but we are proudly say he is the most sucessful pm in india and world we pray for his long term leadership
@reactionworld6939 - What's bad in that to hide the slump. Its done by most of the nations. Its practically no possible to irradiate poverty within years. Everything takes time.
@SwamiSwagz - The Founder of India Jawaharlal Nehru ?   

What weed was the anchor/reporter smoking ?
@darkiftekhar7478 - Very brave and honest reporting, very few people has the guts to do it
@Mohan-jd8fc - Whenever guests come home you try your best to show your best not your problems.
@maharanagguj6191 - Not commonly used but it is official name in Article-1 of constitution!
@jayzxd4400 - I love to see such PR funded by Soros. I love to see their all efforts go into vain. After spending money and putting such efforts they predict that they will keep BJP out of race and afterwards they need require burnol to fix their results. Indian people are enough to handle such PR and all their efforts. 
@avtaar4779 - truth is hidden in india always
@3C273 - Yeah.. without that it will look like California's streets full of zombies
@budwhyy6973 - i would love to meet rakesh ji (at  1:15 )  your optimism is contagious sir. On the contrary, i understand the myopic menatlity of diksha, ask her the same question in 10 years, and she might not even stop to give you ""the bite"" as she rushes to catch a train/cab to her 9-5 media job that pays to maintain her marvelous yet miserbale lifestyle.
@Kush-rc4fz - Tbh it’s good it will bring more attention on how bad there situation is so I hope it back fires on them for trying to hide what you simply just can’t hide 
@Vicky-fl7pv - How humiliating this is for them
@RahulKumar-hr6gr - It's just a meaning of hospitality of middle class family country for our guests not to hide something...u r just describing the cover 
@xamashee - Hiding their own people like cockroaches to please outsiders. Can the world trust those who do that to their own people?
@user-dd1oo9dp5y - Poverty is every where US UK China its every where, India  is still developing after hundred's of years  Under British clutches this is normal don't make it a hype also we know media agencies are short of content these days.
@Pixelated_world23 - I am personally a big critic of the BJP government but these guys ( CH4 NEWS) have nailed it, 
I mean you guys are worse than opposition parties in India.
@tulyamahamunigotrasya - Imagine you have a party at home and your cupboard doors needs a fix because of which all the clothes and articles are looking messy outside. You decide to cover it with curtains to keep it look good to the guests. Now did you commit an offence?
@prakashgupta4845 - Now those leaders who came to india will see this same news 
@ianwilliams14888 - It's very sad to cover up poverty to make it look like a rich country, even though the whole world also knows about the poverty they are hiding
@manumudgal4988 - Twist is that slums are on government land mostly, so goverment can remove it anytime
@ManiacMeats - Colonialism....  ugh, whoever that was is definitely to blame for the situation now.... any idea Channel 4???   Sucks the Indian government is ashamed of it's people but this is the end result of systemic failures over years that have forgotten the people (but never the elite).  Let's just throw something over them and not worry about it.  Your move, Trump!
@subrahmanyansankaran249 - We need 45 trillion reparations from UK and every UK media outlet must quote this figure and India will replace it's slums with that money for sure with audits. Since the west is very fair in every way, that fairness must come to its media also.
@ausgang9495 - The kindergarteners in charge of the declining Western Empire arrive to meet mature Asian and Russian leaders. The kindergarteners have allowed a low level conflagration to threaten world peace and impact word inflation. The kindergarteners have converted economic bastions of low inflation into debt filled economies with spiralling costs. The kindergarteners  have shown no understanding of diplomacy, preferring to scrap. The kindergarteners peimary concern is foe themselves and their careers and pockets and not the countries they manage.
@kakacicimakutuyoung - What happens to the covered slum areas After the Summit ?
@anshumansinghtomar7413 - Yes we did hide and it’s no shame in doing it, and most importantly those guys have supported a lot,” Salute to them,” and it’s matter of respect. And most importantly when our guest come to over house we clean our house same goes when our parents come to our hostel rooms, but it’s beyond your head cause you are living YODA in earth, we will develop some tech to send you back to Star Wars.
@commonindian2861 - If a lion is called a cow, will it start eating Grass ?  If a cow is called a lion will is start hunting other animals and start eating the flesh ?  What's in a name ?  The concepts and  ideas are more important. In politics the issues are more important...
@massphulparas778 - I am Indian great India love you india
@shishiryadav4222 - Like there are no slums in New York and no poor in London??
@BarinTaki - Jawaharlal Nehru University(JNU) is full of communists. And government is also building settlements for people in slums but they refused it because the slums are closer to the city and provide better job opportunities.
@sidali2590 - Thanks for covering this feel sorry for the slum dewellers
@tinaz1818able - India is the most beautiful and cleanest country in the whole universe. No shame at all.
@pradyumnsingh8846 - You can see slums in India's every city . Slums are the part of india. Like a heart. Government and administration both have wrong and bad decisions. 
They spent money on his party or himself not on public problems/poverty.
@bhaqhonq305 - As long as I monitor the G20 hosts, only those in Indonesia look the most luxurious,
@aps2005 - There are many immigrants who illegally crossed borders and then make tents and travael place place 
We are doing to help them but it is also responsibility of neighbouring countries to take on the point
@bobbybannerjee5156 - We indians think the world is too stupid to know
@roadrunner2710 - Poverty cannot be eradicated overnight. Blame the Congress for Indias poverty.
@tenzinthinley8764 - Slums are tolerated normally because these are the places where maids, gardeners, private guards etc of india higher middle class lives in cities. Otherwise how can they bear high rents on the pittance they get as salaries. Slums are stark reality of indias wide economy gap
@nishapundir5704 - I think we should openly show our slums to let our invaders know that this is because of them and still we're managing and improving. It's not us who have to be shameful about this, it's you who should do that whose economy was running on looted money
@hiddentrails6735 - It’s good to see some haters!

India must be doing something right 
@jabberjaw84 - 1200 homes and businesses destroyed by the Government.... That's messed up. They wouldnt even let her take her food out of the house. What kind of cruel government does this to their citizens??!? And what now that they're sitting outside homeless??
@Sam-yt9qj - It's unfortunate that the poor people are the ones who are suffering the most in the summit. India is a developing country and should not be ashamed of its reality. However, the way the narrative is being spread, as if the poverty is because of the work of the current government. It's okay to criticize the government, but is it really a crime to be a Hindu Nationalist? Seriously, White Christian media?
@darshansingh4375 - Modi doesn’t promote India , he is promoting himself. The huge amount of money spent to promote his narcissist image should be spent to alleviate poverty, not to hide it.
@surendrarakwal6940 - This is GOVERNMENT RIGHT STEP
@sashapillai7430 - British News is always knocking PM Modi. 
Most of the settlements are ILLEGAL. They have homes elsewhere. They are there to make money. 
P M Modiji  has raised the standard of living of at least 500 million Indian citizens in only 9 years, but British reporters never report these things.
@GUTSYtheRottweiler - Admit it that we all know these slums are going to be MODIfied into houses & buildings very soon in MODI raaj only!!   Bharat 🇮🇳
@ozychester2295 - India has the third most billionaires of any country on the planet, yet we send them aid. Maybe this can be a topic for the G20.
@Yuda_Lbs - I am quite concerned about Indian citizens who live under a racist government regime that oppresses its own citizens
@jessrifa - Indonesia 🇮🇩 was truly successful in holding the G20 without hurting or hiding any harm.

@terasci5102 - This is the true india. Show the rich, hide the poor
@preapple - India is a more secular inclusive and representative term. BHARAT ignores the contributions of Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Turks and the British to modern India. Height of hypocrisy is how BHARAT continues and leverages its English skills to gain global economic dominance in BPO.
@qwechen-vr1vz - India's G20 forced demolition of slums and slums has not received government subsidies, sighing everywhere. What is the significance of hosting the G20 summit?
@indianmongoose - for 75 years this is what congress did to india
@scazemoeh - That’s terrible! The poor locked up! Shocking leadership. India used to be a country that had true leadership, we were proud to be a nation united in diversity. Shame!
@parthprashar8498 - It's so comical that the narration is trying to give a vibe of uncovering some profoundly shocking revelation about society and politics. This overly pessimistic mindset is not new and frankly is not  beneficial for anyone. A pragmatic stand needs to be taken for ""improving"" the country in actuality. Whining about the G20 is not the way to go.
@user-zj8cf3fq8e - They need better solutions for the poverty and homeless.  These actions and policies doesn't solve the problem.

@vkuttus - Lol I think channel 4 got the visuals mixed up, it looks like Coventry road in birmingham or Ilford in london. Some of the most poorest and disgusting places in the world is in uk
@xenocrates7 - Rest of the Media:- Let focus on G20
Channel4News:- Slum
@sonia____02 - Did India just change the name of the country which has colonial roots or also boycott English language, electricity, gas stove, refrigerator, cars, roads, railway tracks, western outfits, shoes, modern transportation, modern education, modern medicine, etc which has colonial roots as well.Every single item of daily life that makes the life easier and comfortable is invention by the colonialists.They should leave it and return to their ancient culture properly.
@anaghdash9489 - Shame on kejriwal. He has failed as a CM. After remaining in power for about a decade, this is his development?

@alibalaabdullahi6531 - Long live Modi from Africa. We love you
@asisranjanbehera9267 - They should be relocated to nearby city outskirts and should be given basic amenities such as electricity, sanitation and water and subsidised bus facilities for working in city. They should not be allowed land rights at their existing slum. Because there are middle class people who purchase a land with there lifetime's income,it prove them fools if slum people get land free of cost. these people occupy land that is worth billions of dollars. That land should be used for development of nation just like Dharavi.

@abuwilliams7228 - The headline is an Insult to India. There are slums In the UK: London, Liverpool and the list goes on.
@desireswithhope - Keep spreading propaganda. Keep hating on majority of Indian population by calling them as Hindu nationalist as if it’s a bad thing to be a Hindu and to be a nationalist. It’s pathetic there are so many sikh Indian nationalist, Muslim Indian nationalist, and people from all religion in India who are nationalist and love their country and should be in limelight. 
@thegreatest3651 - sarr please keep green screen safe for next event, save tax money 
@LapisPhilosophorum222 - I don't think you realise that these shacks were built illegally in the first place!
They literally start their slum colony in the middle of nowhere all across India. And most govts look the other way, playing appeasement politics for vote-bank.
Why shouldn't the govt do away with such ""homes"" though? Overtime they will start unreasonably claiming their ""ancestral land"" which was illegally occupied in the first place! Happens every time. 
@mansigupta8076 - America has also slum areas why you are targeting only India.

@rockff7203 - Why do this media focus on just negatives things of a country can't you show the positive side as well as negative.
@PankajYadav-qf7sb - Where poor people doen't exists? Even USA has slums and homeless people. so whats the issue if there are such people in india. Indian middle class income is increasing and more people will come out of poverty in coming years. Imagine we are 5th largest economy. where will we be if  thee is no one poor left ?
@sagarpatel3043 - The level of poverty media show in India, I never see them in real life despite I come from Bihar.  I have personally never seen hungry people they are taken care by the government, even local people are generous enough to help them. I don't know about illegal immigrants though.
@raisyanita1407 - Disembunyikan dengan cara apapun tak akan memberi manfaat sebab di zaman sekarang, seorang miskin yg tak mampu ke luar negara pun banyak tahu tentang situasi sebuah ibukota negara lain karena handphone di tangannya. Dan fakta benar nya adalah new delhi adalah ibukota paling tertinggal dan kumuh dibandingkan dengan ibukita ibukota negara g20 lainnya.

@Akash-nb7lu - They should have get more closer look. This was not enough. Like go inside who slums. See what they eating, shitting.
@pduttagupta - Even if India becomes the richest country in the world , there will still be poor peopke. There are layers to poverty in india which western media will never acknoledge..poverty of Nepal n Bangladesh is also brazenly passed on as indian poverty or hindu poverty by a biased western media and their indian counerparts. Poverty in india has definetly come down sharply in last 3 decades but this is never acknoledged.

@Thenobelfan - Awesome , the comments here are not that this is an aching need and pathetic , but most of them compare India’s poverty vs the poor in UK/US …. well then might as well compare per capita GDP , percentage of people in poverty … people do anything for plausible deniability …. Compare how dirty India is vs most developed countries … yet we look at random countries like Pakistan who are at the bottom of the barrel to compare … instead of compare how no Indian  city comes even close to Shanghai … time to wake up

Hilarious
@prasadkulkarni975 - Looks like these foreign medias want to focus more on slums rather than G20 summit.
Why don't you give some aid to them instead of focusing camaras on them???
Just ask a question why these people are poor?? Indirectly colonial loot is responsible for their poverty.
@pankaj3746 - Each and Every country have poor and homeless people(Including so called developed country like US and France).

World is beautiful with rich and poor. Just love İndia how it is. İf İndia goes to space than they say why poor İndia want all this. They will always speak negative. Keep going forward İndia as this is no İssue. Only thing worries me is the rights of Minorities

And By The Way This Poverty Is Direct Result Of Your Loot From India, Give Us Our Money Back There'll Be No Poverty In India. For An Developing Country India Is Doin' Great But For A Developed Country I Don't Think Britain Is In Good Position, I Mean You've Got More Inflation, More Homeless People, And Your Country Was In Crises Few Months Ago So I Think Y'all Should Focus On That. India Is Developing And Will Continue To Develop And In Few Decade It'll Surpass Britain By Lord Krishna's Grace.

@loremipsum7685 - Now where does Hindu Nationalism come here?? India is a developing country and poverty is a reality, and so is the fact that we've brought the most number of people out of poverty in this decade. 
I've seen homeless in US, drug addicts and prostitutes in UK on street..If they're on the way where top 20 leaders and delegates would pass, you'd remove them right? India is growing, so is income of people..even I started my life from those slums.

@saibalsengupta6643 - Why is the media so obsessed with the G20 hosted by India? Doesn't the same thing happen when other countries host similar international events? Instead of criticizing the progress of the country, media should make more documentaries and items that show how 'poverty' was created by the colonial powers for hundreds of years. Why don't we see more coverage of historical facts like Churchill preventing ships with food grains from reaching India so that the famines continued? Why don't we see documentary films about corrupt politicians who got super rich in the name of mega events like the Delhi Commonwealth Games? Perhaps a few JNU 'elite' students could speak about these issues too. Let the progress we have made on our own not be overshadowed by the legacy left behind by previous successive governments.

@skylark5249 - These slum dwellers have been asked to leave from since early 1970s but foreign funded NGOs and local mafias need them for drug peddling and other nefarious activities. Even Sanjay Gandhi (Nehrus grandson) tried to forcibly evict these slum dwellers and even tried to castrate the men.  Im glad the slums have been removed, so long as those people are provided secure housing elsewhere. As far as Nehru making India in his image, that old fart only weakened our nation and perpetuated the colonjal hangover and subservience. Imagine having a 2 British civil servants owing allegience to the UK as our first Army and Navy Chiefs post independence. Such was the myopic view of the hedonist Nehru. We want India to reclaim her lost glory and to rise again to become the worlds most propserous nation.

@backpropagation8365 - What a bunch of BS. These people are not poor. All these people have fridges, cell phones, TVs in their homes. They are squatters refusing to leave. India has enough cheap housing to rent and Delhi has very cheap transportation to move around. If you still insist that you want to squat so you can pressure the government for compensation for relocation, I say ignore the ‘poor’ and cover them up. India today is full of opportunities. Squatting in public land is illegal and government is well within rights to evict.

@hindjourneys - Let me expose you - These slums have more illegal rohingyas and bangladeshis. Opposition parties provided them illegal identity cards for vote bank. The current govt doesn't do appeasement politics and doesn't entertain illegal migrants that's why foreign media, anti India forces, and the opposition is using tactics to defame India. We understand your propaganda. Modi is doing what is best for India. India would be a developed nation if the past govt did what Modi is doing right now. Congress party ran govt for 70 years and did nothing for India and poor people. For Congress, poor people are the vote bank.
@kapilsata212 -  channel 4 news for you

@tidal1637 - Population with 1.4 billion and just over 3.5 trillion GDP, what do you want to see? New York? London? Etc.. Just wait.. Allow us to grow and see  what we can do.. We will live in better condition then yours. With just 3.5 trillion gpd.. It's not a fare game to compare with the west.   Do you agree?

@Amuzic_Earth - I was more inclined towards use of the name ""India"" internationally...but after seeing that placard with ""Bharat"" written on it, I must admit, it does carry more weight, like the literal meaning of the word....and I have also come to realize, while the word India reminds me of young, tech loving country with vibrant, colorful and energetic people, the word Bharat reminds me of ancient civilizational and continuous history, a land of spirituality in its truest sense and wisdom, a true melting pot of people from all over the world... Hence I love both and I think so far the name Bharat was overshadowed by the Name India, but each carry their own representation and should be uplifted equally.

@torontoinoneday5605 - Human Beings are a part of the environment.  Human rights and dignity should be respected in India and around the world.

Let's get one thing straight:

@rockstarjyotsna9819 - Proud of Bharat

@imranuddin3658 - ایک پڑوسی کو بلاکر  اور دوسرے پڑوسی کو نہ بلاکر مودی صاحب نے اپنی نفرت کو کھل کر دکھایا ھے۔ یہ وہ وقت تھا کہ دوسرے پڑوسی کو بھی بلاکر اپنے بڑے ھونے اور ایک فیملی بن جانے کے ثبوت کا وقت تھا تاکہ اس ریجن میں بھائی چارہ بڑھتا اور وہ فیملی جو ایک ہی کلچر اور ایک ہی زبان سے تعلق رکھتے ہیں۔
 یہ بات یاد رکھئے کہ مصیبت کے وقت  سب سے پہلے پڑوسی ہی کام آتے ہیں ناکہ سات سمندر پار جو کبھی بھی نہ بھائی اور نہ ہی کبھی پڑوسی ھوسکتا ھے۔ اور خاص کر وہ دوست جسکی تاریخ ھے کہ وہ دوست تو ضرور بناتا ھے مگر اپنا کام نکل جانے کے بعد اسکی کیا درگت بناتا ھے جس کی مثال صرف پچھلے تیس سال سے بھارت کے سمندر پار کے قریبی علاقوں کی بربادی ھے جو غیر ضروری جنگوں سے کی گئی ھے۔اسکے اٹرات سو سالوں تک باقی رہینگے۔

@brittanynicolette9473 - Managing money is different from accumulating wealth, and the lack of investment education in schools may explain why people struggle to maintain their financial gains. The examples you provided are relevant, and I personally benefited from the market crisis, as I embrace challenging times while others tend to avoid them. Well, at least my advisor does too, jokingly.
@samrat4404 - Its a proudful moments for all Indians. JAI HIND  JAI BHARAT

@safanayasmeen9017 - The only youtuber.. Who describe everything clearly and honestly..
@asmaghafoor7687 - Wonderful explanation 
@Shiva-co3tv - Mr Rathi, Govt's achievement is not that India is hosting G20 summit. The achievement is that G20 is being held on such a grand scale for the first time in its history. The Govt is using this opportunity to showcase its achievements (UPI, AI, space technologies, etc.) and culture to the world. Govt held meetings at more than 200 places in India. It could have hosted everything in Delhi. But this was done to boost tourism and business in all states and cities. The G20 delegates are sharing on their social media their visits to Nagpur, Guwahati, Bhubaneswar and other Indian cities too. This leads to exposure for India's tier 2 and tier 3 cities which will help in tourism and trade for all times to come.
@alonee_boy01 - After watching your videos I feel totally satisfaction 
@prembhatta172 - Your great bro for providing such informative video with us..

@deepasharma1818 - Thankyou Dhruv for the video, this is very helpful. Tomorrow is my exam and this is gonna be very helpful. Thankyou again ️
@aayupyakuryal5715 - I think that Nepal should also get a chance to represent in G20 summit as we have a top level Economist Dr. Swarnim Wagle who served as a senior economist in the World Bank and Chief Economic Advisor at the UNDP Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific . He was also called during the economic crisis in Sri Lanka to give suggestions to solve the recession . His knowledge about Economy is very substantial , broad and wide .
@alexalbin2333 - excellent, you never disappoint.
@artislife456 - I really admire modi and bjp’s PR and advertising team..The G20 summit would have been held in india irrespective of whichever government is in power,but smh he has made it all about him..Similarly with the chandrayaan missions and other foreign investments that are coming in,would have happened regardless of who is in power..But,his team is an expert in making him the hero everywhere..I think we all can take a leaf out of modi ji’s book in setting ourselves up for success..
@diyabhattacharya6911 - Hi Dhruv, I am a long time admirer of your work and the ideology that you try to convey through your videos. Just purchased your ChatGPT course. Hope it’s a worthwhile investment! Can’t wait to start learning and tapping the next level of innovation & technology.

Including African union as a permanent Member.  Making a joint declaration which means all countries agree  to all the points in that declaration which is really very difficult  .

@avijitdutta6979 - Hosting the G20 was maybe the part of the process, but how the host is hosting the summit is the great deal, and The Indian/Bhartiya Govt has nailed it, From the opening ceremonial meets through The Delhi declaration ( which is more diplomatic than the Zelensky's career) to the dinner Hosted by our Respected President madam it was a success....but some khangressis will say its a diplomatic satire that Govt has not invited Kharge( who did not participated in the Independence day parade)  or the Italian lady, though the other Italian lady is having a great time with her Indian counterpart.

@sparklingx4448 - The G20 is already an empty shell. Developed countries are in G7, while developing countries are in BRICS+. With the deterioration of the global economy, it is impossible for both sides to reach a consensus. It can only be agreed upon within their respective organizations and then submitted to the United Nations.

@AR_for_You - Bhiya please make a detailed video about what is economics
@Deepanshu-Rajput - 6:10 But today, after the hosting in Delhi, there are not only 20 but 21 members because Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also given a permanent place to the African Union in the G20.

During the inaugural session of the two-day G20 Summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that the African Union (AU) had been granted permanent membership in the Group of 20 largest economies (G20) worldwide.

@charukhanduri1120 - Ikr he must have said something shot about PM in this video. ..(didn't watched the video) ....but i'm 1000000& sure 
@Param.G.C - At least in google, this is the first time different meetings are held in different cities unlike the previous summit, this is even liked by other countries, I like Dhruv rathee explaination but he never explain how Indian government is giving importance for foreign policy and how is it useful for India, for example the new quad where India got invited by Israel, Cyprus, Greece quad which helps in getting gas reserves and even India with help of other countries bid there, these things will help us not to rely on one group of countries if there are some sanctions or war or some other things.

@Mehrab.Arshad - It may not be a big issue for a rich man but it is a big issue for a normal person and that is that Delhi has become a hub of mobile thieves and the administration here is not listening to it at all.

@alimuzaffar5281 - G 20. It is like that classroom where all the eligible and knowledgeable people meet with mostly have the same purpose only with different and twisted intentions or we have to say or characterize it as knowledgeable, because world leaders are more should be counted among those who take their decision under a great monitoring and when they have analyzed and examined everything than they release a scheme and what better way than a humongous meeting and humongous in a sense look at the publicity and what blind dept has been used up to decorate the capital and that's another point, that people may take a hold off. It is. the capital so we have to fill it flower ports and uncountable flower pots. No calculations or a detailed inscription won't be shown up front, that why money has flowed more quickly even than water. People will not stand in the direction where something proper could be laid out because there is no outlook. Installing holograms and a few other technologies and calling out that our education system has sort out. Then no and promoting these events thus shows it.

@it17harshahuja81 - Overall conclusion for Druvh Rathi is that, it is not a big achievement for Bharat. 
He always puts hatred before success of nation. 
@darsh_era - Plz make a video on Mahatma Gandhi's Life story....
@indfliperboy750 - Proud to be indian 🇮🇳
@utkarshgupta2875 - Have you ever heard about joint declaration? I am sure you have. But you did not take any pain to make a video on it or include it in your video. One sided story can never be called as informative video. I hope you share balanced stories.
@sangameshpatil2096 - Dhruv rathee never disappoints as a leftist
@ayushking353 - i just love ur videos  now a days crime are rising against men please make video on that no laws are here for men

@bts_army27. - His content always impressed everyone 
@M1551NGN0 - G20 being hosted in India is not an achievement. Achievement is that 73 topics were successfully discussed and decided upon and India had diplomatically resolved the Russia Ukraine war issue raised by someone.
@im_goblin_ff4642 - I don't know why people hesitate to call themselves as  Bharatian

@Balajiinstitute-zw3bp - धन्य है वो माँ जिसने आपको इस दुनिया में जन्म दिया 
@Param.G.C - When you don't know anything, whatever he says sounds great. Do chech out different views from both left and right and make your own analysis. Druv is a official AAP party spokesperson so don't get hijacked by his views. That applies both the sides as mentioned earlier.
@veer00123 - Kuchh log bolte hai ki kya hi ukhad liya hamne pichle 8-9 saal me. Aap kisi bhi party ko support karte ho , no matter but ek baar aapne dil se socho aaj se 8-9 phele Bharat ki image or aaj ke samay me Bharat ki image. English me bhi likh sakta tha but ye lines dil se nikli hai or 'Dil Hai Hindustani'
@kavitachauhan3847 - If you don't count hosting the summit as an achievement, atleast appreciate the efforts that had been put by the governing body. Don't always try to backlash your own country's  achievements by using the name of government. Show the positive aspect as well if you can highlight the negatives.
@moshamreaction5694 - Hello namaskar sir me goverment job ki tayari karne wala ek student hai aap sabhi summit ek ek kare isi tarah explain video banayiye please sir badi meharbaani hogi

Where the developed nations see this war as a global fight b/w Democracy & Autocracy, developing nations see it as a relatively regional war but one with profound effects on global commodity prices. Hence we are all more focused on diversifying our supply chains to deal with the latter because tbh, taking sides in a far away war is really a luxury none of us can afford.

There are many developing countries, for example in Asia Pacific, Africa and Latin America, have far more issues such as food security, climate change to discuss than the Russia Ukraine war. Just because it's important to Europe and NATO countries, it should not overshadow the G20 summit. It's in fact the matter of survival for many developing countries. yet, the correspondent kept pressing on one issue to get some brownie points. Unfortunately, she did not get any.

@critical_thinker06 - 7-8 years of growth? I think he is deliberately ignoring the work of governments before Modi. The truth is growth slowed down in the current regime even before Corona pandemic. And there are multiple indicators that suggest Indian economy is not in the best shape. The Adani scandal and the government turning a blind eye to it has further damaged India's reputation as a safe place for investment.

By showing some of the bad  things about slums at the end of the video. In whole video they did not even praise about India's management about this global event at the location where around 32.9 million people are living.
@jagrookdawra - Let me make it clear to all the viewers in the west- India is governed by laws. No one, including a PM can evict a person from his/ her house if the house/ land belongs to that person legally. All these evictions are of unauthorized squatters who do not own those places, but set up temporary shops/ houses on roadsides and government land. DW must tell its viewers how would the German Government deal with such squatters? Would Germany allow such squatting in any part of its capital or any other city?

@shriradhakrishnakripa - DW can't even hide it's frustration .
@Analysis_Dock - I am Indian i want to mention the house or shop demolished by Gov is because they captured Government road department land .
The affected person doesn't hold any inch land they just came and do small vendor business at road side eventually captured Government land . But people can ask why govt demolished now?why not before? My simple answer is because lot of Government land captured by people whenever government need those land they send legal notice if person doesn't hear then government demolished.
@neilnelson7603 - That Indian negotiator at 2:52 didn't mince his word. Outright called out Europe for making a fuss over Ukraine war when others are suffering a war of their own.

It is the weakest economy ever, recording a trade deficit this year and even reducing exports. South Korea's national bankruptcy in 1997 was good for exports and trade, but it was a problem with foreign exchange reserves, but the problem with South Korea in 2023 is that no one trusts it, so the economy will fall out of the top 20 within several years.

The lords statues made out of stone which once fixed/installed during the temple construction will never be moved. While the Utsava Moorti are the idos made as a representatives to the main idon in Graba Gruha. These Utsava Moorthis are made of a mixture of 5 metals. We call that as Pancha Loha. Pancha means 5 and Loha means Metal. Utsava Morrti are brought out of temple during festivels, processions and other events. This Nataraja swami idol is also made of 5 metals.
